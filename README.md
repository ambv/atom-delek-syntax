# atom-delek-syntax theme

A theme based on David Schweikert's "delek" colorscheme in Vim. Very high contrast, mostly blues and greens used.

Known issues:
* not all punctuation is using gray colors, currently impossible in Atom
* LESS class names describe colors that don't necessarily match actual colors used ("orange")
